Here are some ideas to improve the project in the future:

- Use a cloud database like MongoDB to store user data and logs.
- Enhance security by encrypting user passwords using a method like bcrypt.
- Increase test coverage by using Jest for testing.
- Add integration and end-to-end (E2E) tests to ensure everything works together.
